# CrossChat
World of Warcraft addon, "CrossChat", lets you send whispers to Horde (enemy) or Alliance players. 

# USAGE:
just target someone and type /cc

or you can also be like 
    /cc Frank-RiceFields
    or
    /crosschat Frank-RiceFields
    
if you want to whisper Frank from the RiceFields realm

# FUNCTIONALITIES:
1) You can whisper the other faction.
2) They can reply back to you (they don't need addon)
3) You can ignore them if they act like a child xd

# EXAMPLE
Frank is horde but you are alliance. You are Ethan. Here is Frank's screen
    [Crosschatbot] whispers: [Ethan]: truce? I will ask my guildies to stop camping you if you leave m'lady alone
    to [Ethan]: truce!! sounds like a deal. Sorry I killed her :^) she took my ore! haha xD XD
    [Crosschatbot] whispers: [Ethan]: No big deal pal :) Just don't do it again 
    
Here is your screen:
    to [Frank]: haha XD she's a girl so you should know better than to attack her like that -.-'
    [Frank] whispers: Cx my bad buddy i just assumed it was a little kid. Sorry for the misunderstanding
    to [Frank]: don't talk to me or my son ever again XD
    
    
It's cool because they don't need the addon to message you back
